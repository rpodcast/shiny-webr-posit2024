# Introduction Story

## After Database Lock

::: {.notes}
A clinical trial just achieves their primary database lock. A multitude of analyses and visualizations are generated with the "real" data.
:::

## Volume of Outputs

::: {.notes}
Imagine you are reviewing these results. Sure, the primary analysis results meet the benchmark for statistical significance. But this is a complex disease state, requiring you to investigate how key efficacy, lab measures, and safety link together. 
:::

## Static

::: {.notes}
Time to comb through many static outputs. How many outputs are there total? Over 1,000 tables, listings, and graphs.
:::

## Can we do better?

::: {.notes}
Instead of opening / reading these static outputs, what if we had a streamlined interactive application to optimize the review process?
