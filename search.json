Imagine you are reviewing these results. Sure, the primary analysis results meet the benchmark for statistical significance. But this is a complex disease state, requiring you to investigate how key efficacy, lab measures, and safety link together."

The good news is that the technology is here now, thanks to the amazing innovations powered by open-source. Over 10 years ago, Shiny was released to empower R users with the ability to create interactive feature-rich web applications using R code.\nMore recently, the webR package was revealed at last year’s posit conf to bring the power of web-assembly to the R ecosystem"
